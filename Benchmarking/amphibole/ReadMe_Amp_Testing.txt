Files in this folder benchmark Thermobar to existing tools relating to amphibole equilibrium. 

Holland_Blundy_Plag_Hbl.ipynb benchmarks the Hbl-Plag thermometer to the results on Tim Hollands website, reads from Holland_Blundy_RiMG069_Benchmark.xlsx, from Anderson (2008) RiMG069

Amphibole_Putirka_Ridolfi_equations.ipynb - This benchmarks to the spreadsheets from Keith Putirkas website (which include many other thermometers and baromters), 
and the supporting spreadsheet of Ridolfi (2021). Reads from Python_Amphiboles_Test.xlsx, where results from Keith's spreadsheets are pasted in.

Ridolfi_Chemometry.ipynb - This benchmarks the delta NNO and H2O calculation from Ridolfi (2021) (see Ridolfi_Chemometry.xlsx)

Mutch_2016.ipynb - This benchmarks Thermobar to a spreadsheet supplied by Euan Mutch for this barometer (Mutch_Amphibole.xlsx)

Zhang2017_Tests.ipynb - This benchmarks Thermobar to the supporting information of Zhang et al. (2017) for the 14 chemometry equations they supply.
