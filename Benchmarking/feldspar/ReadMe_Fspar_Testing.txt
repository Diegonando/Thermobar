These workbooks and excel spreadsheets benchmark Thermobar to existing tools for Feldspar-Liquid and two feldspar thermobarometry and hygrometry
Small discrepencies (on 3rd -4th decimal place) reflect the fact that many studies use slightly different molar masses. 


Masotta_2019_Plag_Hygr.ipynb benchmarks the hygrometers to the supporting spreadsheet from Masotta (2019).

2_Feldspars.ipynb benchmarks to the supporting spreadsheet of Putirka (2008) for 2 fspar thermobarometry

AlkaliFeldspar_Temp.ipynb benchmarks to the supporting spreadsheet of Putirka (2008) for alkali feldspars. 

Plagioclase_P_T_H2O.ipynb  benchmarks to the supporting spreadsheet of Putirka (2008), including pressure, temperature and hygrometer equations from Putirka (2008) and (2005)

Waters_Plag_Liq_H2O.ipynb benchmarks to the supporting spreadsheet of Waters and Lange (2015).
