Introduction and Citation
==============================

Welcome to Thermobar - An Open-Source python3 tool for performing mineral and mineral-melt thermobarometry, hygrometry and chemometry.

This tool is currently in progress, with planned submission to Volcanica in the near future.

We welcome user feedback/requests for new functions to be included. You can either email the lead author (wieserp (at) oregonstate.edu), or post a enhancement request/report of a bug on the Issue page of the github page. https://github.com/PennyWieser/Thermobar/issues

If you have used Thermobar in your work, please check back periodically for whether it has a DOI. At the moment, it is best to cite my GSA 2021 abstract:

Penny Wieser, Maurizio Petrelli, Jordan Lubbers, Eric Wieser, Adam Kent, Christy Till. Thermobar: A critical evaluation of mineral-melt thermobarometry and hygrometry in arc magmas using a new open-source Python3 tool. GSA connects 2021. Portland.

Please also reference the original paper for the equation you have choosen as well as Thermobar.

For example, you might say in your paper "We calculated plagioclase-liquid temperatures and water contents by iterating equation 23 of Putirka (2008) with the hygrometer of Waters and Lange (2015) using the iterative algorith implemented in the Python3 tool Thermobar (v.0.07, Wieser et al. 2021).

Units
==============================

Thermobar performs all calculations in Kelvin for temperature, kbar for Pressure.
If you want results in celcius, you simply have to subtract 273.15 from results.
